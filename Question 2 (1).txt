Answer 2- (i)- String
          (ii)-String
          (iii)-list
          (iv)- Float
          
Answer 3- (i)  / (This operator is use for divide two number and show dividend)- 4/4 output -1)
          (ii) % (This is modules operator which shows reminder of division of two number)- 4%3 output -1)
          (iii) // (This operator is use for divide two number and show dividend)- 4/4 output -1)
          (iv) ** (This operator is use for power of number ) 2 ** 3  output 8)
          
Answer 7- Mutable object- In mutable object we can change the stored value in predefined index
          ex- list = [0,1,2,3,4]
          list[0] = 4
          
          output- list = [4,1,2,3,4]
          
          Imuttable Object- We can not change the stored value in predefined inder
          ex- string is immutabble object
          s = "saurabh"
          s[0] = b
          
          output
         TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
            Cell In[32], line 1
            ----> 1 t[0] = "b"

            TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
